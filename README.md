## What it does
Keeps you informed about the crimes in your neighborhood. It alerts you, when you or your children cross into a dangerous area of the city. 

## How we built it
My team and I built an Android app, website and a simple API using Java, Javascript, PHP, CSS,HTML,Bootstrap,Google Maps API, Braintree API and GeoJson.

## Challenges we ran into
The most difficulties we had with getting our technology stack to work across multiple platforms, but still using this same data set, that has been scraped from the local police stations websites. The data we used in our project is publicly accessible, but there do exist companies, that collect this kinds of data extensively. The data was in .csv format and sadly, it was not divided between columns, so every row was a very long string with lots of information in it. We had to parse it using regular expressions and built a work around, so that we could easily normalize this data. The project itself was a serious challenge for 4 students, that just began their second year at the university. 


## Accomplishments that we are proud of
My team and I are proud, that we were able to create a multiplatform solution in a matter of 24 hours. We divided our team and in pairs tackled various tasks from various angles, so that at the end we were able to focus together on creating a simple API for our multiplatform solution.

## What we have learned
We have learned, that even the most ambitious projects are not impossible. Thanks to the developers from the sponsoring companies, we have learned alot about problems, that we could run into, if we would go with our approach. Thanks to this knowledge and long discussions, we have learned about new concepts and new ways of thinking when it comes to designing databases, software and solutions. (and friendship)
